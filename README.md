# Economy-API
Small economy API

## Javadocs
Latest Javadocs can be found [here](woutdev.github.io/Economy-API)

## Example
Look at my small and simple [ShopSigns plugin](https://github.com/WoutDev/ShopSigns) that uses this project as its API to withdraw and deposit money for selling and buying items from the server using signs.

## Implementations
My basic implementation is still work in progress and will be placed here once it's ready for the public
